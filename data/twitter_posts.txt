2024-04-15: Just published my latest article on Medium about building Knowledge Graph-based RAG systems! Improved accuracy by 37% compared to traditional vector search. #KnowledgeGraphs #RAG #AI

2024-04-10: Excited to share that I've joined Community Dreams Foundation as a Machine Learning Engineer! Looking forward to building innovative AI solutions for HR and support systems. #NewRole #AI #ML

2024-04-05: Hot take: Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs often beats using giant API models for specialized domains. Lower latency, better privacy, and more control. Been seeing great results with Mistral 7B + LoRA. #LLMs #AI #OpenSource

2024-03-28: Just finished implementing a RAG system with ChromaDB for a job transition recommender. Hit@5 score of 0.87! Async processing cut API latency from 12s to 4s. #GenAI #RAG #ChromaDB

2024-03-20: The synergy between vector databases and knowledge graphs is underexplored. Vector search for semantic similarity + graph traversal for relationship understanding = powerful combination. Working on this hybrid approach now. #VectorDB #KnowledgeGraphs

2024-03-15: Current tech stack for our production RAG systems: LangChain + Mistral + ChromaDB for fast prototyping, with custom pipelines for production scale. What's everyone else using? #LLMOps #RAG

2024-03-08: TIL: Caching embeddings at both chunk and document levels reduced our vector search costs by 68% in production. Small optimizations add up! #VectorDatabases #CostOptimization

2024-03-01: Just gave a talk at Stevens Tech on practical prompt engineering for production systems. Key takeaway: structured outputs + chain-of-thought reasoning + robust error handling = reliable AI systems. #PromptEngineering #AI

2024-02-25: Running benchmark tests on different vector DB solutions. So far, Pinecone edges out on speed for our use case, but Weaviate's hybrid search capabilities are impressive. #VectorDatabases #RAG

2024-02-20: Excited to graduate from Stevens Institute of Technology with my MS in Machine Learning in May! It's been an incredible journey deepening my AI expertise. #GradSchool #MachineLearning

2024-02-15: Controversial opinion: Most RAG implementations are overengineered. Start simple - good chunking strategy + basic search is often enough. Add complexity only when you hit specific bottlenecks. #RAG #AI #Engineering

2024-02-10: Been experimenting with Llama 3 for our customer support chatbot. The quality improvement over Llama 2 is substantial, especially for nuanced conversations. #Llama3 #CustomerSupport

2024-02-05: My go-to embedding model recently: all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Fast, efficient, and surprisingly effective for most RAG use cases. What are you all using? #Embeddings #NLP

2024-01-30: Just deployed a custom trained NER model for extracting structured data from technical documents. 95% accuracy and 10x faster than manual processing! #NER #ML #DataExtraction

2024-01-25: Thread: 5 lessons learned from building AI data pipelines at scale:
1. Data quality trumps model complexity every time
2. Build observability from day one
3. Automate validation at every stage
4. Design for incremental processing
5. Monitor drift continuously
#MLOps #DataEngineering

2024-01-20: Working on a project to extract knowledge graphs from technical documentation. The combination of LLMs for relationship extraction + traditional NLP for entity recognition is powerful! #KnowledgeGraphs #NLP

2024-01-15: Published my article on scaling AI data pipelines in production environments. Reduced processing costs by 78% while improving throughput 5x! #MLOps #Scalability #DataPipelines

2024-01-10: Multimodal models are transforming how we build AI applications. Currently exploring MM1 for a project that integrates document understanding with visual inspection. #MultimodalAI #ComputerVision

2024-01-05: New year resolution: Contribute more to open source AI projects. Starting with some PRs to LangChain for improved ChromaDB integration. #OpenSource #AI #LangChain
